 AdColonyNativeAdViews are used to display non-fullscreen AdColony ads in a fashion that matches the look-and-feel of your application;
 it contains the video and engagement components of the native ad and manages the display and playback of the video.
 Event handler block properties are provided so your app can react to ad-level events such as a open or close.
 The object also exposes additional information about the advertisement that is intended to be displayed alongside the video.
 The native ad may include an engagement button which is fully customizable by the publisher.
 Instances of this class should not be initialized directly; instead, use the AdColonyNativeAdView passed back the success handler in
 `[AdColony requestNativeAdViewInZone:size:options:viewController:success:failure:]`.
