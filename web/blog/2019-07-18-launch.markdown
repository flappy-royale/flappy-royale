## Hello World!

#### Orta & Em - July 18th 2019

We've launched! Wow, it has been a bit of a whirlwind of a beta. We weren't quite prepared for the level of popularity
Flappy Royale received.

The Flappy Royale beta stood stable at **30 games per second** at peak, and over the course of the last three weeks over
**10 million games** were played. We opened with many platforms - but eventually cut that down to just the web demo when
we flew through the limit of testers on iOS.

During the beta we re-created the networking from scratch twice to handle the load, we think this current approach is
scalable for the long term now. We also built out a **new system for getting new characters and attire by finding
eggs**.

Right now we've got about 200 new unlockables, you can win them by playing Royale mode - the better you do the more
likely you are to get a better egg. All of the different unlockables have the same physics boxes, so picking a smaller
character doesn't make the game easier.

### Flappy Stats

Because we regularly are asked what is a good score:

-   20% of games don't make it past the first pipe.
-   27% make it past one pipe.
-   18% past the 2nd.

So basically, get past 2 pipes and you're 2/3rds of the way towards winning!

In the daily trial, we are seeing getting past 100 as being about the amount to get in the top 10. Here's a video of
Lucie getting to [95 pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H_nKIagcpM) if you think that's impossible.

### Thanks

We want to thank everyone who emailed or tweeted feedback and bugs, we might not have been able to get back to all of
you but it's been an overwhelming few weeks.

-   [Zach Gage](https://twitter.com/helvetica) from letting us co-work at his space in the first few days, handling
    advice on ads, to being an impartial third person in many system debates - Zach's influence is everywhere.

-   [Danger](https://www.instagram.com/gemmamcshane/), Orta's wife and an artist in the game - she started with play
    testing but eventually created her own suite of unlockables.

    [Smash JT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPNSVj161Q) you all get it.

### What's next?

Well, for now it'll be nice to chill out. Both of us have just got new jobs and it's kinda important we get that right.
We're open for ideas on what do do next with the game, and where you'd like to see it go to. We'll definitely be
shipping more unlockables
